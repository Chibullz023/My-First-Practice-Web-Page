	<p style="text-indent: 4em;">I've actually dones a few projects in html
		before and created my own website. I used notepad and created a website that linked
		to other pages. The links were inside pictures so that you could click on a picture
		and it would link to another website about the picture. This was many years
		ago back when I attended Truman College.</p>
	
	<p>As far as projects that I would like to do, I would love to do more website linking. 
		That is very interesting to me. As well as learn how to add all the different types of 
		tables and borders all these websites seem to have.</p>
